- Credit reporting, repair, or other
- Debt collection
- Consumer Loan
- Mortgage

Dataset Source: [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database)

## üß† Project Workflow

The notebook includes the following key steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understanding the distribution and nature of complaints.

2. **Text Preprocessing**  
   - Lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, stemming/lemmatization.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words vectorization.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Multiple classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üì¶ Dependencies

To run this notebook, install the following packages:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
