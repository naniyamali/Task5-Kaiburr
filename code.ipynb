After confirming my identity, I am immediately transferred to The Office of Consumer Affairs where I am treated horribly. The staff play games with the dispute process, open cases, close cases, again and again. Theyve confirmed receipt of the FTC Complaint for fraud due to identity theft and still refuse to remove the fraudulent collections debt from IQ Data International. Their pattern of behavior is unfair, frustrating and tiresome. This fraudulent debt should never have been allowed on my credit report. XXXX is the only Bureau continuing to allow it to remain. I have attached page 1 of more than 10 pages of lawsuits currently filed against I Q Data International.\",\n          \"My account with XXXX  XXXX was never late! I have had exceptional payment history with XXXX  XXXX and all payments were placed on Autopay. This late payment that is reporting is a result on a systematic error on their end processing my payment. \\n\\nThis was clearly a billing error made my the company and is not a reflection of my payment experience which violates USC Code 1681eb. This error has caused severe hard to my reputation, my character, my mode of living and to my family! I demand the late payment reported in to be removed. \\n\\nThey are not in compliance with the following law. 15 USC 1666b and its requirements set the standards and the guidance for a creditor to treat a payment as late, yet they are reporting a payment as late and they did not comply with the law! \\n\\n15 USC 1666b ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. \\n\\n\\nXXXX  XXXX Never Sent the periodic statement along with the disclosures from section 1637 ( b ). \\n\\n\\nI have requested proof that this information was mailed or delivered 21 days before the payment due date and this information was requested in good faith pursuant rule 1002 and It was never provided. \\n\\nThis is unfair, illegal, fraudulent, and not equitable to me as a consumer! \\n\\nDelete the late payments from my consumer reports\",\n          \"This is the several times I've complained about being a victim of identity theft.
